Users

Creating an account with the Reservations app is as easy as logging in via CAS or whatever other authentication system your administrator provides. The user will be automatically directed to fill in some typical account information, prompted to read the Terms of Service, and presto! His/her Reservations account is set up and ready to go.

Checkout persons
-------------------

Administrators and users with "checkout person" privileges can create accounts for other users by first navigating to the **Users** tab ![Users Tab]({{ site.url }}/reservations/images/users-1.png) and clicking **New User**. 

![New User]({{ site.url }}/reservations/images/users-2.png) 

The patron will need to provide his/her login credentials and other account information and will accept the Terms of Service upon first checkout.
