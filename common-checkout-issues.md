* I can't add this item to the cart! What gives?

![Search]({{ site.url }}/reservations/images/permissions.png)

Some items require special training before they can be checked out. If your account has not been certified with the training, you won't be able to add these items to the cart even if you are reserving/checking them out for someone who **is** certified. This is a known issue of Reservations, though it may not necessarily be changed in the near future (Administrators may want to prevent checkout-persons from having free access to these special items). You will need to ask the patron to make the reservation from their own account.

* Reservations didn't register the dates nor the user I was trying to make a reservation for!

This is another known issue with Reservations. Unfortunately, the only working solution is to resubmit the user ID and dates until they register on the Finalize Reservation screen. This is an open issue that the Reservations team is currently working on.
