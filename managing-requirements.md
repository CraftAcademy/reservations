A **Requirement** in Reservations indicates that before a patron may check out a particular piece of equipment, they must have first completed training on the safe operation of said equipment. For example, one might insist that patrons be able to demonstrate how to properly set up and safely pack up an expensive piece of equipment, before they be allowed to check it out and use it.

A requirement can be applied to multiple equipment models, for example, different but similar types of digital camera. Patrons are alerted as to necessary requirements before they are able to reserve the blacklisted equipment, and presented with contact information for how to become certified to check out said equipment.

Admins can establish and edit requirements from the Equipment dropdown menu on the top navigation bar. From the Requirements page, admins can review existing requirements, and create new ones.

When creating a new requirement, it is possible to select multiple equipment models for which the requirement applies. To do this, click on the first model you would like the requirement to apply to, and then while holding down the Control key on Windows (the Command key on Mac), click once on each additional model you would like to select.
