* It didn't register the dates I wanted to check out for!

This is a known bug of Reservations that we are working on. The current work around is to re-enter the data and re-submit it until the finalize reservation page displays the correct information.

* Help! It says I can't reserve equipment on XX day!

Some equipment offices are not open on certain days; your administrator may have blacklisted specific dates because you won't be able to realize your reservation on those days. For example, if the office isn't open on the weekend, your administrator may have set it so that you cannot set your reservation start nor end date on the weekend.

* But it's a day when the office is open!

This is another known issue. Depending on the settings your adminstrator provided, people with checkout-person privileges may be able to override this notification.

* I can't reserve more than X items of Y type?? Or for Z days??

Your administrator may also have set limits on the range of equipment you may be able to check out.  Depending on the settings your adminstrator provided, you may be able to find a willing checkout-person to override these restrictions. Contact your administrator for proper procedure.
