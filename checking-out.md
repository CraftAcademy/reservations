Only items whose reservation dates are today can be checked out. To check out an item without a reservation, simply [make a reservation]({{ site.url }}/reservations/user-doc/making-a-reservation/) whose start date is today. The application will automatically redirect to the checkout page after the reservation is made.

Reserved items that are ready to be checked out are accessible through the check in/out tab of a user's profile, similar to equipment ready to be [checked in]({{ site.url }}/reservations/user-doc/checking-in/). In addition to checking off checkout procedures, the specific serial number of each item needs to be supplied as well. Once all this information has been supplied, `Check Out` to finalize the process
