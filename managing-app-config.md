This guide is a walk-through for the Reservations "Settings" page.

The **Site Title** is the name of the website as displayed in the upper-left corner of the top navigation bar, as well as in the [title bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_bar) of your web browser. The title should be fewer than 20 characters in length, in order that the top navigation bar not become too crowded.

The **Admin Email** is the email address of the person who receives daily reports from Reservations regarding checkout/checkin irregularities (i.e., if a Checkout Person notes anything wrong with an item or reservation).

The **Department Name** is used in email correspondence with patrons. It is usually the name of your organization.

The **Home Link Text** is the text which will appear on links to your organization's home page. For example, the text "Wikipedia" in "[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)".

The **Home Link Location** is the web address or URL of your organization's home page.

The **Contact Email** is where messages submitted through the Contact Us form at the bottom of each page are sent to. Because Reservations uses a contact form rather than simply posting the contact email address, the address is afforded some degree of protection from computer bots and spam messages.

The **Items Per Page** setting indicates how many items should be displayed on the catalog page before items spill onto secondary pages.

It is possible to upload a **[Custom Favicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon)**. This is helpful for maintaining a consistent branding and identity across your organization's web domains.

When the **Terms of Service** change, the admin can force all patrons to accept the new terms of service before being eligible to check out new equipment by checking the **Force all patrons to accept the TOS again?** button near the bottom of the Settings page. Notifying users of changes in the Terms of Service may or may not be required by law in your jurisdiction; it's probably best to err on the side of caution and check *Yes* whenever the Terms of Service change.
