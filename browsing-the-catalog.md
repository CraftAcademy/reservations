Every equipment item is listed by category on Reservations' main page view, and it is possible to simply click through the pages to find the page you might be looking for. Note that occasionally the pagination of items will change as the system is updated with new equipment.

If a user knows what item they are looking for specifically, the search bar will return a page (or two) of all the relevant items matching the query.
