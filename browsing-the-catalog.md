There are two ways to browse Reservations; page-browsing and the search box.

Every equipment item is listed by category on Reservations' main page view and it is possible to simply click through the pages to find the page you might be looking for. Note that occasionally the pagination of items will change as the system is updated with new equipment and as the Reservations codebase is updated as well. 

If a user knows what item he/she is looking for specifically, the search bar will return a page (or two) of all the relevant items matching the query.

If you are in an equipment office with the physical piece of equipment, locating it in Reservations is as simple as scanning (or typing) its serial number/barcode into the search bar.
